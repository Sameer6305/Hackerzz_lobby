## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### localStorage Structure:
```javascript
// Each user has their own data
userData_${userId} = {
  communities: [
    {
      id: "1697558400000",
      communityName: "Web Developers Hub",
      projectDomain: "Web",
      members: [...],
      joinedAt: "2025-10-17T10:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  projects: [
    {
      id: 1697558500000,
      name: "E-commerce Platform",
      description: "Full-stack web app",
      createdAt: "2025-10-17T11:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  hackathons: [
    {
      id: 1,
      name: "Cosmohack1",
      prize: "₹ 25",
      registeredAt: "2025-10-17T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  profileViews: 15,
  contributions: 23
}
```

### Event System:
```javascript
// When user data changes, event is dispatched
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('userDataUpdated', { 
  detail: userData 
}));

// Components listen and auto-update
window.addEventListener('userDataUpdated', handleUserDataUpdate);
```

### Dynamic Stats Calculation:
```javascript
getUserActivityStats() returns {
  communitiesJoined: communities.length,      // Real count
  projectsCreated: projects.length,           // Real count
  hackathonsParticipated: hackathons.length,  // Real count
  profileViews: profileViews,                 // Incremented count
  contributions: contributions                 // Incremented count
}
```
